Apocalypse Transportation is a challenging, balance-based driving game in which you take control of a supply truck during a time when the world is on the verge of an apocalypse! People are being hoarded up in bunkers for safety, but they need supplies - and fast! You're their only hope, so stock up, and make sure you get as many resources to you can to the bases before you run out of gas! Just be careful, it's all too easy to drop your cargo, so take it slowly, and be sure to upgrade your truck for more space!
