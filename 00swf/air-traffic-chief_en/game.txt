Description:
Organize the busy skies and guide the planes and helicopters to a safe landing in Air Traffic Chief. Keep your cool and don't let the numbers overwhelm you and most of all, do not crash. If you like to land a plane just draw a route for him and wait till it lands using your mouse. Do this for all the planes and helicopters. You have three runways so it`s pretty hard to land many airplanes. Be focused and try to see every planes trajectory to avoid crashing.

Instructions:
Use your mouse to drag flight paths for the aircraft to land on the runway and drag helicopters to the helipad.
